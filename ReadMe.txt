This is a collection of scripts I developed for the JAWS screen reader by Freedom Scientific,

The scripts are intended to improve accessibility and efficiency in various applications.  The scripts were written for earlier JAWS versions and earlier application versions, however, so they need testing and updating to become current.

The script packages, contained in zip archives, are listed in the following order of their development:

kitsetup.zip = Scripts for Notepad, WordPad, JAWS Script Manager, Notetab Pro, and Microsoft Word, which all create a consistent user interface called the "Homer editor interface."

tb_scr.zip = Scripts for Mozilla Thunderbird.

FxMax.zip = Scripts for Mozilla Firefox.

 IEMax.zip = Scripts for Internet Explorer.
