This is a collection of scripts I developed for the JAWS screen reader by Freedom Scientific,
http://FreedomScientific.com

The scripts are intended to improve accessibility and efficiency in various applications.  The scripts were written for earlier JAWS versions and earlier application versions, however, so they need testing and updating to become current.

The script packages, contained in zip archives, are listed in the following order of their development:

kitsetup.zip = Scripts for Notepad, WordPad, JAWS Script Manager, Notetab Pro, and Microsoft Word, which all create a consistent user interface called the "Homer editor interface."

msenv2005.zip = Scripts for Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and 2008, developed with assistance from others in the blind programming community.

tb_scr.zip = Scripts for Mozilla Thunderbird.

FxMax.zip = Scripts for Mozilla Firefox.

ScriptTemplate.zip = An extensive set of event functions, with debugging support, designed to serve as an initial basis for developing JAWS scripts that improve the accessibility of an application.

IEMax.zip = Scripts for Internet Explorer.


Note that the zip archives for IE, Firefox, and Thunderbird include the InPy web client, which is also available independently at
http://github.com/JamalMazrui/InPy

For all these packages, the many InPy files should be placed alongside other script files in the JAWS user script directory, so installing more than one of these packages simply replaces the same InPy files on disk.  If the Web Client Utilities command, Alt+Shift+Space, is not desired in these scripts, the InPy files may be removed.
